//To practice DOM manipulation, we want to create a web page for seeding a crypto wallet.
//Crypto wallets typically have a phrase of 12 words which allow the owners of the wallet private access to its content.
// Create a web page with 12 HTML elements of the same class and use JavaScript to populate them.
// In your JavaScript create an array of 24 words and then use a query selector to return all the 12 elements as a NodeList.
//Finally, use a FOR loop to iterate through the NodeList and insert into the HTML a random word from the array of words
//Bonus: For your random word selection, ensure that no word is repeated
